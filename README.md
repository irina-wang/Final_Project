## About tufts RIDES

tufts RIDES is a web app that allows students and visitors to see the distance and direction they are from a certain stop as well as the arrival times and a schedule of the shuttle. This way, students will be able to plan what time to leave in order to get to the stop on time.

The map shows how far away from a stop you are. Below the map, there is a list of stops as well as the times until the next shuttle arrives. The two times show the closest arrival time and the second closest arrival time.

## Why tufts RIDES

- Current Tufts Shuttle on the Tufts Mobile app is difficult for new Tufts students or visitors to use as it does not give exact locations of the stops and its direction to that stop
- Tufts Rides finds the closest stop and gives navigation route and time from the userâ€™s current location
- Shows the times of the next two shuttles scheduled to arrive
- All necessary information can be easily and quickly found
